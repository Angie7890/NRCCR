Events: Need to improve this page pretty bland - plus would be good to get the data from a database table and to have a proper calendar component not my hacky table - I think the following are useful:

Notification Bell: To only appear on the first page not all others or to go white on them where the icon overlaps with the 'lozenge'

Championship: *** CAT-3 need to be able to click a round to get the summary of the qualifying results and the final results etc. plus the 150 total - see:
               " http://www.newcastlercracers.uk/bbk/mtg14/heatrndsum.htm - nothing for this
               " http://www.newcastlercracers.uk/bbk/mtg14/f2r0.htm - nothing for this
              http://www.newcastlercracers.uk/bbk/mtg14/f2r2.htm - we have a table for this (probably don't need bar a link and deep link into Race Results)
              http://www.newcastlercracers.uk/bbk/mtg14/f2r1.htm - we have a table for this (probably don't need bar a link and deep link into Race Results)
              OR... better still add a qualifying summary and finals summary to the race Results too in the "Race" end drop down that shows this data
              Plus need to do the 150 i.e. if Qual 1st = 50 + if A1 1st 50 + if A2 1st 50 = 150 - lose a point per slot back...
              *** (CAT-3) Could we do a 'modal' style window for this...it appears on clicking anything in that round's column?
              Need to get the After to update automatically using the DB to get details...

Race Results: **** CAT-1!!! I've added a pick another season to the bottom and anchored it under the graph (may not work on mobile mind) BUT need to
              ensure that changing the value clears the page and provides alternate gets i.e. summer db not spring db - help...!
              Need to make the drop downs more attractive some padding around the entries in the drop downs
              selecting a crop down to the left doesn't update the page - you must change last drop down to activate a change
              *** CAT-2 the date order doesn't work on the middle one i.e. not chronological
              *** CAT-2 need to order the plot by the race winner at top
              *** CAT-1: bug noticed whereby sometimes graph doesn't populated right (but data is in DB) e.g. 4wd -> 19/02 -> H2 - Gary has 20 laps in the data (which looks clean)
              CAT-2: related see on 4wd -> 09/04 -> F1 - for me - I only did 2 laps but the best lap is a crazy number like when the thing fails above......

Cars and Setups: Need to check the way I've dropped it into tables to make sure it will work on a mobile, narrow view too...
                 I need to populate it out further...

Video: Need a 'video gallery' so that the choice of videos in future can play instead of the default welcome video...

Contact Us: Need to loop to key people and be clear who the board is PLUS need to embed facebook in some way

Loading Scripts: Need more testing of the loading scripts and need to workout how to move to a new series - i.e. post Spring 2018?

General SPA Behaviour: need to find out why sometimes it drops the icons / images and changes the font on the left hand nav....?

Contact Us - New Page: can we link to the Facebook page?  Can we embed the latest postings on here in some way?
