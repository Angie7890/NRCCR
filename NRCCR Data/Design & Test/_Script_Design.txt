Need to rename files from:
heats 050318 -> heats-20180305

Need to remove some spurious lines
Need to check dates - some had the wrong dates (admin error on BBK side)

Don't need column Race Name (Race Class has it)
Don't need column Overall Qual Result Laps (Overall Qual Result Laps has it - actually would be better to keep and drop Laps from the combined field)
Must remove trailing d from some Lap Times (first lap)
Must add a date column from the filename i.e. 20180305
Remove rows with Round or Leg = 0 (only in finals files)

cut -d"," -f1,2,4,6,7,8,9 finals-20180212.csv >>>>
Name,"Race Class","Overall Qual Result",Result,"Round or Leg","Lap Time","Lap Number"
"Gary Wilkinson",4wd,"20/  311.17 ","18/  305.97 ",1,"   10.48d",1
"Gary Wilkinson",4wd,"20/  311.17 ","18/  305.97 ",1,"   15.10",2
Not sure why some column headers have quotes and others don't and same point but not matching on data rows...
Need to strip the white space
Need to split field on Overall Qual Result and call Overall Qual Time and keep column Overall Qual Laps
Ought to do the same with the result column too i.e. Race Result Time and Race Result Laps
This seems best:
cut -d"," -f1,2,4,6,7,8,9 finals-20180212.csv | sed -e 's/d\"\,/\"\,/g' | sed -e 's/\"   /\"/g' | sed -e 's/\/  /-/g' | sed -e 's/\ \"/\"/g' | grep -v "DNS"
Add the race date to each row (then need to work out how to rename first entry/row to "Race Date")
cat heats-20180326.csv | sed -e 's/$/\,"20180326"/g' > heats-20180326.csv.x
need to also change Round or Leg to H1/2/3/4 for Heats and F1/2 for Finals

Then need to run the import into Mongodb
